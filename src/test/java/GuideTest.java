/**
 * Welcome to your first lab! This lab will identify all the different entities that you'll be creating and

 *
 * This file is a CLASS. A CLASS is a blueprint for generating an OBJECT. For now, you can think of a
 * Class as its own program, whose functionality gets executed whenever one of its methods gets used. A method is
 * something that an Object can 'do'. Objects contain states (variables) and behavior (methods).
